# GeostrophicCurrentExperiment
This study investigates the prediction of geostrophic current velocities for the next seven days using three distinct machine learning models: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a GraphSage-based model, and a Multilayer Perceptron Fourier Neural Operator (MLP-FNO). By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to determine the most effective approach for forecasting geostrophic currents within a week's timeframe.
